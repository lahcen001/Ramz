## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Timer Rules:
- Timer starts when quiz page loads
- Cannot pause or stop timer
- Auto-submit occurs at exactly 0:00
- Timer persists through browser refresh (starts over)
- Timer is client-side but validated server-side

### Time Limits:
- Minimum: 1 minute
- Maximum: 1440 minutes (24 hours)
- Default when enabled: 30 minutes
- Recommended: 1-3 minutes per question

### Auto-Submit:
- Submits current answer selections
- Unanswered questions marked as incorrect
- No additional time given after timeout
- Results calculated normally

## 🚨 Technical Implementation

### Timer Logic:
- Uses JavaScript `setInterval` for countdown
- Stores start time in component state
- Calculates elapsed time on submission
- Server validates submission timing

### Data Flow:
1. Admin sets timer → Saved to Quiz model
2. User joins → Timer info sent to client
3. Timer starts → Countdown begins
4. Time up → Auto-submit triggered
5. Submission → Time data saved to database

### Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation if timer fails
- Manual submit always available
- Server-side validation of time spent
- Fallback for network issues

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Elements:
- Large, easy-to-read timer display
- Color progression for urgency
- Warning alerts and animations
- Progress bar for quiz completion
- Responsive design for all devices

### User Experience:
- Non-intrusive until critical

This timer system provides complete control for educators while ensuring a smooth, fair experience for students taking timed assessments.
